# Week 2 - Customer Experience Analytics for Fintech Apps
This weekâ€™s challenge centers on analyzing customer satisfaction with mobile banking apps by collecting and processing user reviews from the Google Play Store for three Ethiopian banks:

- Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)
- Bank of Abyssinia (BOA)
- Dashen Bank

### Business Objective
Omega Consultancy is supporting banks to improve their mobile apps to enhance customer retention and satisfaction. Your role as a Data Analyst is to:

- Scrape user reviews from the Google Play Store.
- Analyze sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) and extract themes (e.g., "bugs", "UI").
- Identify satisfaction drivers (e.g., speed) and pain points (e.g., crashes).
- Store cleaned review data in a PostgreSQL database.
- Deliver a report with visualizations and actionable recommendations.

## Setup
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/Melak12/week-2-Customer-Experience-Analytics-for-Fintech-Apps.git`
2. Create venv: `python3 -m venv .venv`
3. Activate: `source .venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux) or `.venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
4. Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note: if requirements.txt is missing, you might need to run this command
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and reporting for each bank and the overall app review data. Use these notebooks to interactively explore, visualize, and document findings.
- **scripts/**: Contains all Python scripts for scraping, preprocessing, sentiment analysis, database management, and utility functions. Key scripts include:
  - `app_review_scrapper.py`: Scrapes and preprocesses Google Play reviews.
  - `sentiment_analysis.py`: Performs sentiment analysis and keyword/theme extraction.
  - `db_manager.py`: Handles PostgreSQL connection and table creation.
  - `db_io.py`: Handles saving, fetching, and clearing data in the database.
  - `utils.py`: Shared utility functions and enums.
- **sql/**: Contains SQL scripts for database setup and schema management. For example, `reviews_db.sql` can be used to manually create or inspect the database schema if needed.
- **Data/**: Stores all raw, cleaned, and gold-standard review CSVs. Subfolders include:
  - `cleaned/`: Cleaned review data.
  - `gold/`: Processed data with sentiment columns.

## Environment Variables

Database credentials and other sensitive settings should be stored in a `.env` file at the project root. An example template is provided as `.env.example`:

```
DB_NAME=bank_reviews
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update the values as needed for your local environment.

---

## Database Integration

See `scripts/README.md` for full details on database setup, table creation, and usage. In summary:
- Use `db_manager.py` to create the required tables (`banks`, `reviews`).
- Use `db_io.py` to save, fetch, and clear review and bank data.
- All database credentials are loaded from the `.env` file.

---

## Additional Notes
- All scripts and notebooks are modular and reusable.
- Table and column names are lowercase for PostgreSQL compatibility.
- The database must be running locally and accessible with the credentials in your `.env` file.
- For more details on each module, see the respective script or notebook documentation.
